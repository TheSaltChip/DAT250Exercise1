### Technical problems with software dev env
During installation there were not any noteworthy problems that
occurred. Have done these steps before on my own projects, which
helped.

### Validation
Ran maven in a terminal to check if 
1. Maven was correctly installed and placed in Path
2. Java_Home was correctly configured

Which were done by compiling the test heroku project
and running mvn -v

Which worked as expected

### Technical problems with Heroku
When using Java 8 there were no problems

When trying to use something else, namely 14 or 17
it would not run on local. No matter what I did to change 
version it still wanted to run the jar with 8, and I could not find 
where it tells the program to do that

### Pending
Using another java version than 8
